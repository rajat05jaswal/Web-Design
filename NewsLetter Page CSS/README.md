##  Implementation
I have followed the following techniques to use scss
1. Used multiple SCSS files to organize my code.
2. Used multiple nested selectors in SCSS.
3. Implemented mixins as a background image in order to apply the common styling with different varations for an image.
4. Implemented inheritence by using extends so that each element could extend some common properties and use properties of it's own too.
5. Used loops to generate populate multiple images.
6. Used Grid Structure to organize containers into Grids.
