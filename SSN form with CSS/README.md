# Assignment 3 

Created two page as main.html and page2.html and css is written in the folder named as "css" which is on the level of html pages.
Inside the css folder there is main.css containing css for both the pages.

For creating an effective css I have used the following techniques:
1) CSS selectors like classes, id, and elements.
2) Css properties like border, padding, margin for making the content look like the form pdf.
3) Css combinators like > + and space.
4) Pseudo classes and pseudo elements like nth-child, first-child, last-child, after.
